1. 	Add RootTag column populated with parent_tag in DataFrame for Config file in Excel format 
	Manual typing of Primary-Key Value column will be required because:
a.  Flask application code already has used up all available attributes of checkboxes to display the nested hierarchy. 
	So displaying the inner XML data wouldn't be possible for now.
b.  'Primary-key' as a value in XML data might not always be present in the selected number of XML tags. Similarly, Primary-Key won't be mentioned in the XSD File.



2. 	Horizontal tabs for 'Home' and then onclick of 'Proceed' make visible nested hierarchy of XML/XSD Tags on same page
#################	XML Tags list can be very huge. Displaying on same page with scrollable panel.	#################

						Welcome [username] message & [last_login_time] at top-right
